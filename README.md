# Wifi-cracker
I created a programme with python which bruteforce a wifi network and connects to it.
First run the algorithm.py programme to obtain all sorts of password combinations.
At last, the programme will crash but don't worry, just check your algorithm.txt file, and it will contain all the password combinations.
Now run the WifiC.py programme and it will ask for ssid, in ssid field, just enter the name of wifi you want to crack.
In the next field, it will ask for pwd files, in that field, just write "algorithm.txt" and hit enter.
And you are done, the bruteforce attack will began and would run until the password is found.


#NOTE
IF in case, the combinations get over and password is not found, delete the algorithm.txt file and again run the algorithm.py programme and start from beginning.
If it seems boring, remember, its bruteforce attack and it does take time.

We are always open to updates and suggestions!! 

Thank you:)
